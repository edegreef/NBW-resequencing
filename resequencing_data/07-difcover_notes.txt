# Notes on DifCover, comparing coverage of male and female bam files to identify sex-linked regions

# using combos of these samples for the DifCover runs:
M1=HamLB03-2.deDupRG.bam
M2=NBW-2017-03.deDupRG.bam
F1=HamLB03-1.deDupRG.bam
F2=NBW-2016-11.deDupRG.bam

# installing
git clone https://github.com/timnat/DifCover

# use "make" command in the "DifCover/dif_cover_scripts" folder and "chmod +x" for all the scripts in this folder

# install DNAcopy package into R
R
library(BiocManager)
BiocManager::install("DNAcopy")

# make sure bedtools, samtools, awk, and R (DNAcopy package) are in PATH

# calculate modal coverage of bam files
./bam_coverage.sh HamLB03-1.deDupRG.bam

# copy and edit 'run_difcover.sh' script in working directory, then run script
# example of parameters for one run; used 1/3 modal coverage for minimum, 3x modal coverage for maximum, and modal coverage sample2/ modal coverage sample 1 as the AC value; the rest of parameters at default

p=2			# enrichment scores threshold (when p=2 will report regions with coverage in sample1 being roughly 4 times larger than coverage in sample2)
bin=1		# for auxiliary stage (5), generates enrichment scores histogram with scores in bins with floating precision 1. For more detailed histogram use 10, 100
