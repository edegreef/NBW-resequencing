# Lost my notes for breakdancer, but recreating here
#(http://breakdancer.sourceforge.net/pipeline.html)

# First thing, I combined 10 samples to make one large bam file using 'samtools merge'. Breakdancer can take merged bam files as long as header and records have RG info. 

# Downloaded BreakDancer-1.3.6

# Next step, create configuration file with bam2cfg.pl
/home/degreefe/programs/build/bin/bam2cfg.pl -g -h sample.bam > config_out.cfg

# Second step, detect regions of structural variants
/home/degreefe/programs/build/bin/breakdancer-max -t -q 10 -d output.ctx config_out.cfg > output.ctx
